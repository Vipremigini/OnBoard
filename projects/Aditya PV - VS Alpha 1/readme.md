# VikramSat Alpha - 1

Trying to make the world's smallest ChipSat. If launched to space, this will become the world's smallest satellite. To be further developed for light sail missions.

COST: 5477 inr

Had to research for hours to find the right components and if they work together. OFC, trying to design such a small satellite is hard.
